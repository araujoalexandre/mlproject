be more memory efficient => option --save_memory
predict on test at the end of training model instead of the end of the pipeline 

check feature distribution of dataset and warn if distrubution is really different 


build a binary format in C++ called with python 


Re-code LibFFM

Re-code ExtraTrees 
Plug XGBoost 
Plug LigbtGBM
Plug Liblinear

Make a C++ pipeline exclusively in C++
=> mlproject train will be coded in C++
